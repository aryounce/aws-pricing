# AWS Pricing add-on for Google Sheets

:mega: **An announcement about the future of the AWS Pricing add-on for Google Sheets.**

[Strake](https://getstrake.com), in collaboration with [@mheffner](https://github.com/mheffner), is excited to announce that we are inheriting Mike's Google Sheets add-on to continue the great work he started. This repo has been retired and replaced by our [new version](https://github.com/getstrake/aws-pricing-sheets-addon). Also, all existing issues that have not been addressed by the new version have been [migrated to the new repo](https://github.com/getstrake/aws-pricing-sheets-addon/issues).
